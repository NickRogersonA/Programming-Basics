# Inputs and Outputs

## Overview
This lesson is to demonstrate a fundamental programming concept of inputs and outputs using the micro:bit. This includes understanding the basics of an input/output and producing code to represent these fundamentals through checklist task and challenges.

## Learning Objective
The aim of the lesson activity are:
- To learn what an input and output are in respect of the micro:bit
- To learn and understand the difference of an Input and Output
- To learn how to use the online micro:bit A and B button inputs and produce different output outcomes
- To learn how to use block commands such as ‘Show String’ and ‘Show LEDs’
- To learn how to create and display an image as an output on the virtualised online micro:bit
- To learn how to use math functions to create an output using the various inputs
- To be able to add complex inputs to create a specific set of an output or outputs
