# Start Activites: Condition Statements

## Activity 1
#### Brief:
Understanding a Condition Statement

#### Activity:
Create/Draw/Write three different conditions in three seperate pieces of paper, what hand do you write with:
* Left Handed
* Right Handed
* Both Hands

Hand out the three conditions to three pupils side by side in a line and the rest of the group queues up in a single file in front of the conditions to decide which hand they write with. 

Once a pupil decides they stand behind the condition statement they indenify with i.e. if left handed they stand behind the left handed condition. Once everyone has had a chance to go through the condition activity, they have essentially created a condition statement that categories a certain input i.e. I am left handed and will write with my left hand as the ouput. 

Repeat the process again using a different condition this time. Create/Draw/Write three new conditions on three seperate pieces of paper, what colour do you like:
* Red
* Yellow
* Green

#### Understanding Questions:
Question to ask at the end of the starter activity to gain understanding:
* What is a condition statement?

#### Outcome:
By the end of the starter activity, the pupil should be able to explain a condition statement. Essentially it is:
* A condition statement provides you with a choice to go down one path or the other
* Essentially it is a what if senario: if I am left handed I stand on the left of the queue, else if I am right handed I stand on the right of the queue
