# Instructors Material
For sessions which are ran in a classroom with an instructor and approxamitly 15 plus students, some guidance and information are available below to assist with the lesson which includes: a starter activity with the key learning concepts, the main activity to complete on the computer as well as a finishing activity to make sure key concepts have been understood by the pupils.

We usually recommend sessions of 45 minutes broken down into:
* 10 minutes for the Starter Acitivity
* 30 minutes for the Presenting and the Student Activity 
* 05 minutes for the Plenary 

However longer sessions are possible and usually that is extending the Student Acitvity section from 30 minutes to 45 minutes. However it is solely up to you on a case by case basis how you see fit in running the sessions. All the information presented are a guidance and are very designed with flexibility in mind.

## Overview
The main concept for this session is to understand the concept of loops using the micro:bit online editor through the class activity worksheet.

## Starter Activity
Depending on the class size, we usually recommend to break the class in to groups of 5 to 7 pupils. This provides the opportunity for each pupil to have a chance to understand the key concepts visually within a smaller group environment. Multiple [starter activities](StarterActivites) can be chosen depending on your preference, these are used as a guide for inspiration and to help visualise the concepts.

## Presentation


## Main Activity
The main project activity for the pupil to learn, code and understand the hands-on basics of programming [loops](../). We usually recommend to break up the pupils into groups of 2 to 3 to aid in collaboration and knowledge sharing between pupils however these lesson plans can also be completed on their own.

## Plenary
Questions to ask at the end of the session as a collective group of pupils or individuals:
* What is a loop?
    * A sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached
    * Allows you to repeat code until a condition or rule is met,
* What is a repeat loop?
    * A control flow statement for specifying iteration, which allows code to be executed repeatedly
    * A loop that repeats code for a set number specified
* What is a while loop?
    * A control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given boolean (true or false) condition
    * A loop that repeats if the condition (boolean value) is true otherwise stops if its false
* What is a boolean?
    * A binary variable that can have one of two possible values, 0 (false) or 1 (true)
    * A true or false variable
