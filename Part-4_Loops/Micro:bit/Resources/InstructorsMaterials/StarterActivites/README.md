# Start Activites: Loops

## Activity 1
#### Brief:
Understandng a Loop

#### Activity:
Assign a pupil in the group to be a counter for the loop, he should start counting from 1 to 4 (depending how many pupils are in thr group determines the max numner).

The rest of the group should stand in a line side by side facing the pupil in charge of counting. Each students action is to raise there arms and lower it when the counter points at each pupil and till they hit the maximum counting number perviously specified.

Repeat this with a new pupil to be the counter and changing the max number to count to with a new simple action. This is to represent a loop does the same action until it ends.

#### Understanding Questions:
Question to ask at the end of the starter activity to gain understanding:
* What is a loop?

#### Outcome:
By the end of the starter activity, the pupil should be able to explain a loop. Essentially it is:
* A sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached
* Allows you to repeat code until a condition or rule is met
