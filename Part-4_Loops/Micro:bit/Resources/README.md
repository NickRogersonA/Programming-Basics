# Activity Worksheet: Loops

## Introduction
In this project activity you will learn to create loops with different inputs (conditions) to produce different outputs with the micro:bit. This will build upon your pervious skills you have learnt from the previous project activites.

## Part 1: Basics Loops
Lets begin the activity by trying out some simple conditional statement blocks:

- [ ] Open up a browser and go to **[https://makecode.microbit.org](https://makecode.microbit.org)**.
- [ ] Start a new empty project by clicking on the **projects menu** and select the **New Project** menu button in the pop-up screen, this only needs to be done if there is still old code on the sandbox from your previous work.

</p>

- [ ] In the block menu click the **loops menu**, drag the **repeat** block and place it within the **on start** block.

- [ ] In the block menu click the **basic menu**, drag the **show leds** block and place it within the **repeat** block and draw out a stick person standing up.

- [ ] In the block menu click the **basic menu**, drag another the **show leds** block and place it within the **repeat** block and draw out a stick person jumping. What did you notice?

The stick person jumped up and down four times because the **repeat** block repeats 4 times. 

- [ ] Change the number 4 in the **repeat** block to a 6, what do you notice?

The stick person jumped up and down 6 times.

- [ ] In the block menu click the **math menu**, drag the **0 + 0** block and place on the repeat block, change your math block to **2 + 2**. We can add two numbers together using the **maths block** to create an output using additions, subtractions, multiplication and division.

- [ ] Delete the **2 + 2** block and add a variable from in the blocks menu click the **variables menu** , drag the **set item to 0** block and place it under the **on start** block.

- [ ] Change the **set item to 0** variable name to **index** and change the number to 10.

- [ ] In the block menu click the **variable menu**, drag the **index** variable and place it in the repeaet block. We have now created a variable that can be used in the **repeat** block loop.

Did you notice from the last activity we used the **forever** block to make our code repeat, this time we made a loop in the **on start** block todo the same thing. We have more control with creating loops as we can only create certain code to loop and the rest of the code can only run once.

## Part 2: While Loops
We have learnt in creating a simple loop block using the **repeat** block. Lets try expanding on what we learn with the while loop and add get an understanding of a boolean:



## Part 3: If Then Else Then Else Then Else Then... again?


## The Challenge
